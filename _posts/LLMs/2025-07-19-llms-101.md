## <a name="introduction"></a>1. Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models are deep neural networks trained on massive amounts of textual data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. These models learn probabilistic patterns of language using architectures like Transformers.

### Key Objectives of LLMs
- Language understanding (e.g., summarization, translation)
- Language generation (e.g., text completion, dialogue)
- Reasoning and knowledge retrieval

---

## <a name="architecture"></a>2. Architecture of LLMs

LLMs are typically built using the Transformer architecture, which consists of layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks.

### Transformer Block
```text
Input → Embedding → Multi-Head Attention → LayerNorm → Feed Forward → LayerNorm → Output
```

## <a name="tokenization"></a>3. Tokenization and Embeddings

Tokenization splits text into subword units. 

### Why Tokenization Matters
Tokenization directly impacts:
1. Model efficiency: Shorter sequences = faster training and inference
2. Generalization: Good tokenization reduces OOV (out-of-vocabulary) errors
3. Memory usage: Influences the length of sequences fed into LLMs
4. Language support: Determines how well the model handles multi-lingual text

### Popular Tokenizers:
- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
- WordPiece
- SentencePiece

### Comparison of Tokenization Techniques

| Technique | Description | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|-------------|------|------|
| BPE | Merges frequent character pairs into subwords | Fast, widely used (GPT) | May struggle with rare tokens |
| WordPiece | Greedy longest-match-first subword tokenizer | Handles rare words better | Slightly slower than BPE |
| SentencePiece | Language-independent, treats input as raw text | No preprocessing needed | More complex training procedure |

### Embedding Layers
These convert tokens into dense vector representations. Positional embeddings are added to encode order. This allows the model to understand relationships like:
```text
"king" - "man" + "woman" ≈ "queen"
```

### Types of Embedding Layers and Their Characteristics

| Embedding Type | Description | Example Use Cases | Pros | Cons |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|------|------|
| Static Embeddings | Pre-trained and fixed vectors for each word | Word2Vec, GloVe | Fast, simple, semantic relationships | No context awareness |
| Contextual Embeddings | Vary depending on context of the word in a sentence | ELMo, BERT | Captures word meaning in context | Computationally expensive |
| Learned Embeddings | Trained from scratch along with the model | GPT, custom models | Task-specific, flexible | Needs large data to generalize well |
| Positional Embeddings | Added to token embeddings to encode word order | Transformers | Allows sequence models without RNNs | Fixed max sequence length usually |

### Embedding Layer Code Example (PyTorch)
Here's how you typically define and use an embedding layer:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Example: vocab size of 10, embedding dimension of 4
embedding = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=10, embedding_dim=4)

# Input: tensor of token indices
input_tensor = torch.tensor([1, 2, 4, 5])
output = embedding(input_tensor)

print(output.shape)  # torch.Size([4, 4])
```

### Advanced Concepts
1. Subword Embeddings: Instead of words, we embed subword units (e.g., in BPE).

2. Learned Positional Embeddings vs Sinusoidal: Some models learn position vectors (like GPT), others use static sin functions (like original Transformer).

3. Fine-tuning: Pre-trained embeddings can be frozen or fine-tuned on downstream tasks.

4. Multimodal Embeddings: For images, audio, and text to coexist in a shared space (e.g., CLIP).

### Best Practices
1. Use pre-trained embeddings when working with small datasets to avoid overfitting.

2. For sequence models (Transformers), always include positional embeddings.

3. Visualize embeddings using PCA or t-SNE to understand semantic clustering.

---

## <a name="attention"></a>4. Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism enables models to weigh the importance of different words dynamically.

### Intuition Behind Attention
In natural language, not every word contributes equally to the meaning of a sentence. Attention allows the model to assign different weights to different tokens based on their relevance to the current word being processed.

## Scaled Dot-Product Attention

### Step-by-Step Formula:

Given input queries \(Q\), keys \(K\), and values \(V\):

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax} \left( \frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V
$$

- \(Q\): Query matrix (what you're trying to match)
- \(K\): Key matrix (what you're comparing against)
- \(V\): Value matrix (what you're going to retrieve)
- \(d_k\): Dimension of key vectors (for scaling)

### Explanation

- Compute similarity: \(QK^\top\)
- Scale it down by \(\sqrt{d_k}\)
- Apply softmax to get probabilities (weights)
- Use those to get a weighted sum of the values \(V\)

## Multi-Head Attention

Instead of applying attention once, it's applied in **parallel "heads"**. Each head focuses on different subspaces of the input.

```
Input Embeddings
    ↓
Linear (Q, K, V projections)
    ↓
Split into h heads
    ↓
Apply Attention in each head
    ↓
Concatenate heads
    ↓
Final linear projection
```

### Formula:

$$
\text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h)W^O
$$

Where each head is:

$$
\text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)
$$

### Types of Attention and Their Roles

| Type | Description | Used In | Pros | Cons |
|------|-------------|---------|------|------|
| Scaled Dot-Product | Core attention formula using dot products and softmax | Transformers, GPT, BERT | Simple, efficient, effective | Can struggle with long sequences |
| Multi-Head Attention | Parallel attention on multiple projections | Transformers | Captures multiple relationship patterns | High memory cost |
| Self-Attention | Q=K=V from the same input | GPT, BERT | Enables parallel computation | Requires positional encoding |
| Cross-Attention | Q from one input, K/V from another | Encoder-Decoder, RAG | Good for translation and RAG | Doubles compute and memory cost |

## Self-Attention vs Cross-Attention

- **Self-Attention**: Used within a single sequence (e.g., sentence).
- **Cross-Attention**: Used when one input attends to a different sequence (e.g., decoder attending to encoder output in seq2seq models).

## Architecture Diagram (Self-Attention Block)

## Best Practices

Use **masking** in attention layers for autoregressive models (like GPT) to prevent future token leakage. Apply **causal/self-attention** for generative tasks and **cross-attention** for tasks like translation or RAG. **Layer normalization** and **residual connections** stabilize training and improve convergence. **Sparse Attention Variants** (like Longformer, BigBird) are recommended for very long sequences.

## Advanced Attention Variants

| Variant | Purpose | Benefit |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Sparse Attention** | Reduces attention complexity | Useful for long documents |
| **Linformer** | Projects keys/values to lower dimensions | Speeds up large model inference |
| **Performer** | Uses kernel approximations | Linear complexity w\.r.t sequence |
| **FlashAttention** | GPU-efficient kernel | Speeds up training on large data |

## PyTorch Self-Attention

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def scaled_dot_product_attention(Q, K, V, mask=None):
    d_k = Q.size(-1)
    scores = Q @ K.transpose(-2, -1) / torch.sqrt(torch.tensor(d_k))
    if mask is not None:
        scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, float('-inf'))
    attn = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    return attn @ V
```

## <a name="training"></a>5. Training LLMs

Training involves minimizing a loss function over a dataset.

### Types of Training:
- Masked Language Modeling (e.g., BERT)
- Causal Language Modeling (e.g., GPT)

### Pretraining Objectives

#### a. Masked Language Modeling (MLM)

Used in encoder-based models like BERT. Random tokens are replaced with [MASK] and the model predicts them.

Example: Input: "The [MASK] sat on the mat." Output: "cat"

Limitations: Slower inference since BERT is not generative. Mask tokens never appear at inference time.

#### b. Causal Language Modeling (CLM)

Used in decoder-only models like GPT. Predicts next token given all previous ones.

Example: Input: "The cat sat on the" Output: "mat"

Strengths: Enables autoregressive generation. Easy to adapt to downstream generative tasks.

### Hardware
LLMs are trained on multiple GPUs/TPUs using distributed training.

---

## <a name="inference"></a>6. Inference and Decoding Strategies

Inference is the process of generating text from the trained model.

### Decoding Techniques
- Greedy Decoding
- Beam Search
- Top-k Sampling
- Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling

### Greedy Decoding

#### Definition

Always selects the token with the highest probability at each step.

#### Pros

- Fast and deterministic
- Good for constrained tasks (e.g., classification, token tagging)

#### Cons

- Often produces repetitive, dull, or incomplete text

#### Diagram

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Start: <s>] --> B["I"] --> C["am"] --> D["a"] --> E["robot"]
```

---

### Beam Search

#### Definition

Maintains `k` most likely sequences at each time step, explores more options.

#### Pros

- Produces better quality output than greedy
- Suitable for translation and summarization

#### Cons

- Still tends toward safe/generic answers
- Expensive with large beam width

#### Best Practices

- Beam size between 3–10 for balance
- Combine with length penalty to avoid short outputs

---

### Sampling

#### **Basic Sampling**

Randomly samples next token from the predicted distribution.

- Pros: Creative and diverse
- Cons: Can produce incoherent or off-topic text

#### **Top-k Sampling**

Only sample from top `k` highest probability tokens.

- Controls randomness and prevents rare, low-quality words

#### **Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling**

Select tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds `p`

- More adaptive than top-k, dynamic cutoff

#### Best Practices

- Top-k: Use values like 40 or 50
- Top-p: Start with 0.9 or 0.92
- Avoid combining top-k and top-p unless experimenting

---

### Temperature Scaling

#### Definition

Adjusts the probability distribution to be more or less random

- Temperature < 1: Makes model more confident (sharper distribution)
- Temperature > 1: More exploratory (flatter distribution)

#### Formula

```
P'(x) = softmax(logits / T)
```

#### Best Practices

- 0.7–1.0: Balanced creativity and coherence
- < 0.5: Useful for deterministic results

---

### Repetition Penalty / Frequency Penalty

#### Definition

Reduces probability of repeating the same tokens/phrases.

- Used in GPT-style models to avoid looped outputs
- Similar to penalizing frequency from previous outputs

#### Tip

- Repetition penalty \~1.1–1.3 can reduce verbosity

---

### Contrastive Decoding (CoDi)

#### Idea

Combines two models:

- *Base model*: Generates fluent candidates
- *Contrastive scorer*: Penalizes generic or less informative options

Used in recent LLM applications to boost informativeness without loss of fluency.

---

### Guidance and Constraints

- **Token Constraints**: For tasks like code completion or grammar correction
- **Control Tokens**: Used in models like CTRL to steer style/topic
- **Logit Bias**: Bias or suppress certain tokens (e.g., avoid offensive language)

---

### Streaming and Efficient Inference

#### Techniques

- **KV Caching**: Cache key/value attention tensors to avoid recomputation
- **Speculative Decoding**: Draft with smaller model, verify with larger
- **FlashAttention / FlashDecoding**: Hardware-efficient attention computation

---

### Human-in-the-Loop Inference

- Used in critical tasks like legal, medical, and enterprise decision-making
- Models suggest; humans verify and edit

### Summary

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| Greedy | Classification, short form |
| Beam Search | Translation, summarization |
| Top-k | Poetry, dialogue |
| Top-p | Chat, storytelling |
| Contrastive | High-quality generation |

### Common Metrics:
- Perplexity: Measures uncertainty.
- BLEU: Measures accuracy against reference.
- ROUGE: Used for summarization.
- Human Evaluation

### Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Evaluation

**Intrinsic Evaluation** measures performance using metrics derived from the model output alone. These are automated, fast, and reproducible.

**Extrinsic Evaluation** assesses the model in the context of downstream tasks or human feedback.

---

### Common Metrics by Task Type

- Speeds up inference

### Types
- Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)
- Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)

#### Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)

- Quantize a pretrained model without retraining.
- Fast and simple.
- Slight performance degradation.

**Common Formats:** INT8, FP16

**Use case:** Prototyping or deploying models quickly where slight accuracy drop is acceptable.

#### Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)

- Simulates quantization during training.
- Higher accuracy retention compared to PTQ.
- Requires access to training data.

**Use Case:** Scenarios where accuracy is critical.

#### Dynamic Quantization

- Activations are quantized on-the-fly during inference.
- Weights are quantized statically.

**Use Case:** RNNs, Transformer layers.

#### Static Quantization

- Both weights and activations are quantized.
- Calibration is done using a small representative dataset.

---

### Precision Levels

| Type | Size per Value | Example Use |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| FP32 | 32 bits | Training |
| FP16 | 16 bits | Mixed precision |
| INT8 | 8 bits | Inference (default) |
| INT4 | 4 bits | Memory-constrained |

---

### Challenges in Quantizing LLMs

1. **Accuracy Drop**: Especially with INT4/INT8 quantization
2. **Outliers**: Some weights/activations have very large values which dominate quantization buckets
3. **Attention and Softmax Layers**: Sensitive to precision reduction
4. **LayerNorm & Embedding Layers**: Require custom quantization strategies

---

### Techniques to Overcome Challenges

1. **Outlier-aware quantization**
2. **Mixed-Precision Quantization** (e.g., keep attention heads in FP16, rest in INT8)
3. **Per-Channel Quantization**: Each channel has its own quantization parameters
4. **Group-wise Quantization**: Share quantization scale across groups of weights
5. **Activation Clipping**: Helps reduce dynamic range

---

### Quantization Libraries and Tools

- **Hugging Face Optimum**
- **Intel Neural Compressor**
- **NVIDIA TensorRT**
- **BitsAndBytes (for 4/8-bit quantization)**
- **ONNX Runtime**
- **PyTorch Quantization API**

---

### Quantization in Practice

#### Example: Using Hugging Face + BitsAndBytes

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b",
    load_in_4bit=True,
    device_map="auto",
    quantization_config={
        "bnb_4bit_compute_dtype": "float16"
    }
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b")
```

---

### Best Practices

1. **Start with PTQ** for quick prototyping
2. **Use QAT** when accuracy is critical
3. **Monitor accuracy degradation** with validation sets
4. **Profile inference speed** to ensure quantization benefits
5. **Consider mixed precision** for layers sensitive to quantization

---

## <a name="rag"></a>9. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

---

### RAG Implementation Example

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Initialize retriever
retriever = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Create document embeddings
documents = ["Document 1 text...", "Document 2 text..."]
doc_embeddings = retriever.encode(documents)

# Build FAISS index
index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(doc_embeddings.shape[1])
index.add(doc_embeddings.astype('float32'))

# Retrieve for query
query = "What is the capital of France?"
query_embedding = retriever.encode([query])
scores, indices = index.search(query_embedding.astype('float32'), k=3)

# Get relevant documents
relevant_docs = [documents[i] for i in indices[0]]
```

---

### Best Practices

1. **Chunk Size**: Balance between context and specificity (typically 100-500 tokens)
2. **Overlap**: Use overlapping chunks to avoid losing context at boundaries
3. **Metadata**: Include document metadata for better filtering
4. **Reranking**: Use cross-encoders to rerank retrieved documents
5. **Caching**: Cache embeddings and frequent queries for efficiency

---

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Challenge: Irrelevant Retrieval
**Solution**: Improve embedding models, use hybrid retrieval, implement reranking

#### Challenge: Context Length Limits
**Solution**: Summarize retrieved docs, use hierarchical retrieval, implement context compression

#### Challenge: Outdated Information
**Solution**: Regular index updates, timestamp-based filtering, real-time retrieval
