# Flowing Against the Ocean: A Reflection on Persistence

There’s something profoundly exhausting about going against the tide. When the world pushes you in celebrating strength, abundance, and ease, moving in another direction feels like trying to swim across a storm. But some of us never had the option of calm waters to begin with. And that’s what this post is about: trying to stay afloat, especially when every wave is against you.

## Struggling With a Body That Felt Like a Cage

Throughout school, I was that *too-slim* girl who was underweight, dealing with chronic inflammation and back pain. While others focused on carefree ambitions, my days were dictated by physical discomfort. Pain was the only constant, a companion I had never asked for.

However, with time, you learn to adapt. You learn to move despite the pain, to smile when it feels like all your bones are getting crushed, one by one, to meet deadlines while your body demands rest. But make no mistake, it’s never easy.

Throughout my life, I chased one goal with unwavering focus: financial independence. It wasn’t a dream built on luxury or status, but a necessity shaped by circumstances, by the burden of being a girl in a world that questions your every step, by the weight of financial limitations, and by the quiet desperation of wanting to stand on your own feet without relying on anyone. In that pursuit, I sacrificed many things, the most vital being my health. 

Chronic inflammation and persistent back pain weren’t rare episodes, they became my constant companions. It is the price I paid for ignoring my body’s signals until they turned into screams. I pushed through because I had to. There was no fallback, no safety net. Sitting through pain, working through fatigue, and telling myself that rest was weakness became my normal. But the thing about ignoring your health is that it eventually forces you to listen. When your body refuses to carry the weight anymore, you begin to see just how much you’ve lost in the process.

There are days when I wonder if the only real escape would be to give it all up. To stop striving, to stop enduring, to let the tide take me wherever it wants. It's a dangerous kind of thought, but one that surfaces when you feel like you’re swimming alone in the middle of an ocean, without direction, without land in sight. 

The hardest part is how invisible it all feels. From the outside, I might look like someone who has it all figured out, a rising star, someone others aspire to be. But on the inside, I often feel hollow, worn out by the very battles I had to win just to survive. 

The sacrifices I made to get here have changed me in ways I never anticipated. I don’t always recognize the person I’ve become. Somewhere along the way, I lost the version of myself who believed that life was more than just enduring the next blow. I became functional, efficient, and determined but also distant, numb, and often emotionally spent.

This disconnect is hard to articulate. It’s isolating when the world applauds your accomplishments, but you’re quietly grieving everything it took to get there. In the eyes of others, I may be a success story. But deep down, I still wrestle with the thought, who have I become and is she someone I wanted to be?

## Navigating Through a World Not Built for You

Being a girl in a society that still equates worth with conformity comes with invisible weights. Add to that the financial strain, no silver spoons, no shortcuts and life begins to feel like a never-ending uphill climb. Every opportunity had to be earned, fought for. There were no handouts, no safety nets, no fallback plans.

The world often rewards loud confidence, uninterrupted privilege, and relentless speed. But I only had resolve : quiet, stubborn, painful resolve.

## Emotional Drain: The Quietest Struggle

What people rarely talk about is the *mental cost*. When you’re constantly battling your body, gender-based expectations, and limited resources: it's hard to focus on anything else. You're emotionally drained but still expected to function, to achieve, to compete.

You constantly feel behind. That gnawing voice that says, *“You’re not doing enough”* becomes your background music. It takes an immense amount of courage to silence it even for a moment to accept your ground reality without guilt.

## Lessons From the Ground Up

If there's one framework that gave me some clarity, it’s **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**. Understanding that survival, safety, and mental wellness are foundational changed the way I treated myself. You can’t expect self-actualization from someone still figuring out how to survive and that's okay.

I also learnt to **stand up for myself** to speak out, even when the system wasn’t listening. To advocate for my space, my choices, and my pace. I'm still figuring this out on most days, because I wouldn't want to hurt my loved ones in the process.

There is no fairy tale of overnight success here. Just countless days of showing up despite it all, making slow progress when it would’ve been easier to quit.

## Persistence Is Not Glamorous

It's rarely quoted in motivational posters, but this is the truth: **Persistence is messy.** It doesn’t look like triumph, it looks like barely holding it together. It looks like rewriting a blog post at 2 a.m. while your back aches. It looks like being misunderstood, underestimated, and still pushing forward.

And yet, *that* is the kind of persistence that changes people.

## Final Thoughts

Flowing against the ocean isn’t something I chose. It’s the life I was handed. But I’ve learned to swim, slowly, painfully; sometimes with rage, sometimes with peace.

Despite what one might have endured, you have to believe that the good times are not behind you, but ahead of you. It’s easy to drown in the silence of your own mind, to let the world’s applause drown out your inner voice that's quietly falling apart. But somewhere deep down, beyond the fatigue, beyond the self-doubt, there is a small flame that still believes in better days. You have to hold onto that. Because no matter how bleak the present feels, it’s not the end of your story.

I often think about Mike Posner, who turned his life around in the most unexpected way. A man once consumed by the pressure to perform and be seen, decided instead to walk thousands of miles in search of peace, of meaning, of self. That journey wasn’t about proving anything to the world rather it was about reclaiming his own soul. And maybe that’s the lesson in all of this. No matter how bitter life has been, you still have the power to turn it all around. To rewrite your story. To walk your own metaphorical "America".

Some of us have carried weights since we were children: weights of responsibility, of broken health, of emotional turmoil, of being told we’re not enough. But we don’t have to live in that loop forever. We can break it. And sometimes, breaking the loop starts with the smallest of actions: believing that good things are still possible. That we deserve joy, not just survival. That it's okay to rest. That we can be kind to ourselves even when the world hasn't.

And while we’re at it: be kind to others, too. You never know what war someone else is fighting behind their smile. A small word, a gesture, a moment of genuine connection might be the one thing that helps someone else hold on a little longer. In the end, we’re all just walking each other home. So let’s do it with love, with grace, and with hope.

KEEP GOING.
