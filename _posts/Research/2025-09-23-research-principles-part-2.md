description: A clear, practical guide on separating credible sources from misleading ones when engaging in technical research.
---

Most fields today grow faster than individuals can keep up with. New frameworks, architectures, and claims appear daily. Without a disciplined approach to evaluating information, it becomes easy to confuse popularity with correctness. The objective of this article is to provide a method for identifying credible sources while avoiding misplaced confidence in opinions that lack evidence.

## Why Source Credibility Matters

Every technical decision is anchored in assumptions. If those assumptions are based on inaccurate, incomplete, or opinion-driven information, the resulting understanding becomes fragile. Mistakes in early comprehension compound over time, and engineers often realise only much later that they were building on a flawed premise.

Correct information is not enough. It must be traceable, justified, and aligned with reality.

## The Hierarchy of Sources

Not all sources carry equal weight. Treat them as layers, not equivalents.

1. **Primary Sources**
   Original papers, specifications, standards, and reference implementations. These define the truth of a system.
2. **Secondary Sources**
   Books, blog posts, and derivative explanations based on primary work. Useful for context but not authoritative.
3. **Tertiary Sources**
   Summaries, social media threads, and videos. Convenient but often incomplete and prone to error.

When facts conflict, defer to primary sources.

## Characteristics of a Credible Source

A credible source demonstrates most of the following attributes:

* It explains mechanisms, not anecdotes.
* It provides evidence, not conclusions.
* It cites references or original work.
* It remains consistent across versions.
* It acknowledges limitations.
* It does not depend on authority or reputation for acceptance.
* It enables reproducibility.

If a source cannot be validated independently, treat it as unverified.

## Indicators of False Authority

False authority relies on impression rather than substance. It typically exhibits one or more of these behaviours:

* Answers without traceable references
* Uses terminology without definitions
* Conflates correlation with causation
* Offers certainty in domains of complexity
* Avoids explicit assumptions
* Focuses on outcomes rather than mechanisms
* Relies primarily on personal experience

A source can be popular and wrong. Popularity is not evidence.

---

## Evaluating Claims

Every claim should be interrogated using these questions:

1. What assertion is being made?
2. What evidence supports it?
3. Is the evidence reproducible?
4. Is the evidence peer-reviewed, tested, or benchmarked?
5. Are counterexamples addressed?
6. Do the assumptions remain valid under different conditions?

If a claim cannot withstand this scrutiny, it should not inform your decisions.

## The Provenance Test

Trace any important idea to its origin. Doing so will reveal:

* The context in which the idea was developed
* The problems it originally solved
* The constraints and limitations identified
* Whether the idea was superseded or corrected later

Many misunderstandings persist because readers rely on interpretations instead of investigating original work.

---

## Version Awareness

Technical fields evolve. A credible source must align with the versions of tools, standards, or algorithms in use. An outdated explanation may have been correct once but is incorrect now.

Before trusting any statement, confirm:

* The version of the software
* The date of publication
* Whether a replacement standard exists
* Whether the assumptions remain unchanged

Ignoring versions leads to errors that are difficult to debug.

---

## Cross-Verification

If multiple independent sources converge on the same explanation, it is likely correct. Agreement alone does not guarantee correctness, but it increases confidence when those sources:

* Have no direct reliance on one another
* Use different methodologies
* Provide aligned results

Verification reduces reliance on single points of failure in reasoning.

---

## Summary

Research requires judgment. Judgment requires an ability to distinguish between sources that provide reliable insight and those that merely sound authoritative. The core principles are:

* Prioritise primary sources
* Validate claims through evidence and reproducibility
* Question assumptions
* Track version dependencies
* Do not confuse confidence with correctness

When you can justify why a source is credible, rather than assume it, you have moved beyond information consumption into disciplined research.
