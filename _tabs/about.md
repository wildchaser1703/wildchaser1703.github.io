## Hi, I’m Toshali.

This site is my space to explore and write about concepts in **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **AI**, as well as personal insights from my journey as a growing technologist. Writing helps me sharpen my understanding, challenge assumptions, and develop a habit of deliberate learning.

## What This Blog Is (and Isn’t)

Think of this blog as a collection of evolving notes—part explanation, part reflection—crafted as I go deeper into the world of machine learning and problem-solving. These are **learning artifacts**, not final textbooks.

I don’t claim mastery over every topic I write about. Instead, I aim for **clarity over completeness** and **intuition over jargon**, focusing on building strong mental models through examples and analogies.

Sometimes things might be oversimplified, or even wrong—that’s part of the process. Corrections and feedback are very welcome!

## Writing Approach

I like to:

- Anchor abstract ideas to **physical or visual intuition**—thinking in terms of geometry, mechanics, and simple algebra.
- Break complex topics into **simple motivating examples**, then build up.
- Be **concise and direct** when explaining technical concepts.
- Be **verbose and story-driven** when motivating the "why" behind a concept.
- Use real-world inspiration and examples from projects or case studies.
- Layer intuition → definition → derivation → application.

When possible, I try to include:

- **Diagrams** or visuals to build tangible mental models.
- **Code snippets** (especially in Python) for grounding abstract ideas.
- **Walkthroughs of edge cases** or failures to highlight nuance.
- **Questions I asked myself** while learning, and how I answered them.

## Feedback & Collaboration

If you:

- Spot a mistake,
- Have a better explanation,
- Want to share resources, or
- Just want to nerd out over something cool...

**Please reach out or leave a comment!**

Learning is better when it’s collaborative, and I’d love to hear from fellow explorers.

## My Current Focus

Lately, I’m spending time on:

- Building a strong foundation in **ML algorithms & systems**
- Understanding **Generative AI** beyond surface-level hype
- Practicing **DSA + Leetcode-style questions** to build coding fluency
- Writing about **intuition-first ML topics**, interview prep notes, and case studies

## Why This Site?

1. **Solidify My Understanding**  
   Teaching forces clarity. Writing is my way of thinking through ideas out loud.

2. **Document the Journey**  
   It’s easy to forget how far you've come unless you look back.

3. **Help Others Like Me**  
   I want to write the kind of posts I wish existed when I started.

Thanks for visiting!
